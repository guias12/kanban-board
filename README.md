# Frontend Software Engineer - Code Evaluation

The goal of this project is to create a project management tool (Kanban
board). The page needs to be responsive. You're free to be creative and
build an awesome page but you should focus on efficiency.

## Problem Specification:

- Create a responsive page containing a board that handles multiple
  cards and multiple statuses.
- We should be able to:
- Drag&drop the cards between the statuses.
- Filter the cards.
- Search the cards.
- Inline card edition.
- Add new cards.

Please implement your solution using React, Redux (or other state
management library) and TypeScript in any combination with SASS, Less
or styled-components etc.
Please also include a brief explanation of your design and assumptions
along with your code, as well as detailed instructions to run your application
in a README file. We will assess a number of things including the design
aspect of your solution, UI/UX skills, your programming skills and your
ability to write unit or integration tests. We expect you to submit what you
believe is “production-quality” code that you would be able to run, maintain
and evolve. You should submit code that you would be happy to produce in
a real project, or that you would be happy to receive from a colleague.
